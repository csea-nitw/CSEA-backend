    question:
      "Due to the pandemic this year, Santa wanted to give extra gifts to everyone in the world. To produce more gifts, Santa opened five new gift factories around the north and south poles. The Grinch, upon spying on Santa's elves, learned of one these factories and hatched a plan to destroy it and ruin Christmas. When the Grinch shows up at this factory, Buddy, a dimwitted elf, spots him and immediately calls Santa to alert him. Buddy being a forgetful elf forgets which factory he is in, but he tells Santa a few clues about this factory: 1. The Grinch is fighting the polar bears protecting the factory. Since there are more polar bears than elf population in this place, it will take some time for the Grinch to make it to the factory. 2. This factory is near a polar station named after the first person who said 'We are not at the center'. Due to the limited time, Santa can only visit one factory. Can you deduce where this factory is and help Santa save Christmas?",

    question:
      "Before giving him his Christmas present, Santa decided to see if Bob could guess the company that manufactured the product. He explained, 'the current version of this company's logo is likely the one we’re most familiar with, it actually represents a radical change from every iteration of the old logo. Not only does the addition of the colour set it apart from the rest of the old logos, but the softening of the font to a rounded Segoe UI is a dramatic shift as well. Of course, the design is meant to evoke the company’s flagship software product, but rumour has it the colors represent four of the other specific software products as well.' Which company's logo is Santa describing here?",

    question:
      "On the night of Christmas Santa was riding his sleigh to deliver the gifts in a locality which looks like a rectangle of length n units and breadth m units and each house occupies one 1 x 1 area. Due to a strong wind two gift boxes have fallen from his sleigh and are somewhere in the locality these gifts are supposed to be delivered somewhere else. While trying to collect the two gifts, Santa was able to deliver the remaining gifts to maximum number of houses and after collecting the gifts he returned to the initial position and took a good look over the happy/delightful night and continued his journey to spread joy. Can you tell us where the two gifts were dropped in the locality – if every house can be marked as (x, y)  and Santa cannot move diagonally.",
